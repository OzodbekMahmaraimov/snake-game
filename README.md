# JavaScript Snake Game

This is a DOM-based game of Snake that I wrote in JavaScript over a decade ago. It was made to have sort of a nostalgic feel to it.

## Play and Edit the Game Online!

You can now play and edit the game live in codesandbox:

On first load sometimes the game frame will not load correctly and you'll need to press the refresh icon above its display panel to get the game to show.
